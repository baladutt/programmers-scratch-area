# programmers-scratch-area
Every programmer has a scratch area where they write simple programs to understand concepts. 

On June 12 2011 I created it. 

Original is here - https://code.google.com/archive/p/problem-solving

## Original note

"*I have always liked the concept of universities as they were in Ancient Greece, where folks who had something cool to say would just come and say it. It wasn't about recognition; the impetus was the thought that you were resonating with ideas.*" - Donald Knuth


Vision: To make problem-solving fun and not just an evaluation tool for recruitment.

It is about getting better. Goal is to have every serious programmer have such a personal library.

Contents: Set of classes that will help people learn problem solving little quicker.

Please do add code/comments etc.
